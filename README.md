# ngnix.conf
The deployment of Nginx as a web server exhibited similarities in functionality to the 'python -m http.server' command in serving static files through a designated directory over the HTTP protocol. However, Nginx offered increased configurability and versatility owing to its more extensive feature set as a full-fledged web server. Specific enhancements encompassed:
- Broader access controls - Nginx allows for finer-grained specifications of which clients can access the server and under what conditions (e.g. by IP address, hostname, or request headers).

- Advanced caching options - The caching mechanisms in Nginx enable more optimal resource usage through storing frequently requested content.

- Comprehensive error handling - Sophisticated error pages and custom error logs can be defined.

- Modularity through modules - Additional Nginx modules extend the core functionalities, such as for load balancing, access authentication, or dynamic page generation.
